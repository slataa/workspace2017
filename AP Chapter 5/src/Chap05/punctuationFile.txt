This is an input file for PunctuationCounter.java. It will be scanned for
punctuation marks. For instance, it will find period and commas, as well
as semicolons, dashes, and others. It will count the number of each
punctuation mark encountered; the results will be summarized. As a wise
man once said "Count your marks." Well, it's not the most wise statement
you've ever heard, but give me a break - I'm making this up as I go.
